/**
 * The BitPay.com JSON API is accessible at https://bitpay.com/api/. The merchant must obtain an API key from the bitpay
 * website by logging into their merchant account and clicking on My Account, API Access keys. A merchant can create
 * multiple keys for use with different e- commerce stores or API functions. Once an API key has been created, BitPay
 * will use this API key to authenticate your API connections.
 * <p/>
 * The merchantâ€™s API key must remain private and should never be visible on any client-facing code. Should it ever be
 * compromised, the merchant can generate a new key in their BitPay account.
 * <p/>
 * When connecting to BitPay, use HTTP Basic Authentication with the username as your API key and
 * leave the password blank (the following page describes the HTTP Basic authentication protocol in detail: http:/
 * /www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt). You should also only communicate with the server if you can validate the bitpay.com
 * SSL certificate with a certificate authority. Most HTTPS client libraries make this as simple as setting a switch.
 * Similarly, inbound notification connections should only be recognized when the SSL certificate is validated. Taking
 * both of these steps will ensure that you are always communicating with the Bitpay server and that your API key will
 * never be exposed.
